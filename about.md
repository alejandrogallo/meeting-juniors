This is the **Junior meeting blog**.

## Definition

The junior meeting is a space where questions that do not belong in the general
group meeting can be asked. This is also a good place to hold scientific
discussions that are not normally held in coffee breaks, where one tends to
comment on non-scientific aspects as a social recreation.





## Rules

  1. **No slides**: by slides we understand any form of preparation and monologue.
  1. **Short**: the seminar should not last longer than 1.5 hours.
  1. **No authorities**: inside the seminar, there are no authorities,
    contractors are not openly banned, but are encouraged to stay away from the
    seminar activities. In the seminar structure reigns anarchy.
  1. **No question is stupid**: for real.
  1. **No question is stupid**: really.
  1. **Handle respectfully**: but do not be afraid of disrupting, contradicting
    and correcting. One of the reasons why contractors are encouraged to stay
    out of the meeting is that you can fuck up for good and still be socially
    accepted by them, so that they will not fire you, as you deserve.
  1. **What happens inside the junior meeting**: stays in the junior meeting,
    as long as it is not scientific.
  1. **Feel free**: to propose topics and activities for the junior meeting,
    also to change or add rules.
  1. **Topicless**: any topic is good as long as  between the group members
     some clarity can be achieved on the topic.
  1. **Egoless**: leave your ego outside, I know it is difficult.
  1. **No unnecessary abstract talk**: try to reach to the people,
     and try to engage everyone into it, even if you have to go far into
    the basics to make everyone understand.
  1. **Back to the roots**: very basics will be revisited, try not to be bored.
  1. **No coming back**: if you decide to attend to a seminar, you can't leave
    until it finishes.
  1. **Carelessness**: if you are not interested in the topic or you find it trivial
    you should still try to educate others or to let yourself be educated.
    If you don't care, this is not the place for you.


## Target

There are many targets of such a project.

  1. **Learn**: the main target is to learn.
  1. **Connection**: it is also a great space to connect the members
    of the group and help them know each other better.
  1. **Collaboration**: through discussion we may find out ways in which
    to collaborate scientifically in the constant hurdles that we find in our
    daily research.
 1. **Improve**: our understanding. We can also improve our daily life
    easing scientific conversation in a relaxed environment.

## Blog usage

This blog has been prepared in order to give the opportunity to everyone to
contribute in writing form, thus lowering the barrier of doing so.  The usage
of the blog is also pretty much open, however a blog structure is clean and
easily followed. Contributing is also as easy as pushing to a github
repository.

This blog is intended as a post-meeting resource. There will be no workload
to ensure that the participation barrier stays low.

It is very welcomed, if someone decides after a meeting

  -  to sum-up what was discussed.
  -  to enhance the discussion with some relevant and detailed information.
  -  to post related links.
  -  etc...


## TL;DR

Come and see for yourself.
